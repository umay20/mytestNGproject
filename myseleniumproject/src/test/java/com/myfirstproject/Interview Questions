What do you do when your automation script FAILS?
1. Run automation script again to make sure it fails again
2. Do one more time manual testing to see if there is a bug
2a. If you see a bug, then check with devs to make sure that is a bug, then raise a bug ticket if needed. If that is a real bug, then dev fix, and I retest until I observe no more bug, then close the ticket.
2b. If you DO NOT see any problem then go following steps
3.  Check the automation script
3a. Locator might be wrong
3b. Test data maybe invalid(credentials, URL, environment,…)
3c. Typo in the data or locator
3c. If locator, data, env,… is correct then of following steps
4. Check if there is an iframe
Switch to frame
5. Check if there is an alert
Switch to alert
6. New window
Switch to the window
7. Wait issue(Syncronization issue)
Add more wait and use EXPLICIT WAIT(WE WILL LEARN LATER)
