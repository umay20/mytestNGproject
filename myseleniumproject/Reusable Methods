What is Reusable Methods in Automation?
Reusable methods are in our utilities package or in our test base class
We can have multiple reusable classes such as LoggerUtils, ExcelUtils, JSUtils, ScreenUtils, MediaUtils, WaitUtils,â€¦
Why we need to use Reusable Methods in Automation?
1. Faster development
2. Stable Framework. If we keep writing more, we likely make mistake, so we create stable working reusable methods to minimize coding errors.
3. Get rid of redundancy.
4. Minimize exceptions. For example, we can find elements using explicit waits to handle wait issues, or we can use JS clicks methods to handle click issues using Reusable methods.
