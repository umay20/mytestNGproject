public class DataTypes01 {}

    //public:it means it can be used from entire the project.(public library)
    //        There is no any restriction to use it
    //        Public is one of the access modifiers(it is accessible)
    // we have 4 access modifiers: i)public  ii)protected  iii)default iv)private

    //default : it means it is open to a group(Harvard univ.library>>it is open to just a small group not to everyone)
    //         If you make something "default" in Java,it will be used just inside the package
    //         To make something default in java, do not type any access modifier(no need to write,java understands it is default)

    //protected:It means it is open to a group and their kids.(Gym is open to employees and their kids)
    //          this is wider than default bec it includes kids as well

    //private: it means it is specific for a person (driving licence, passport,private property)
    // in java it can be used just in that class.Whe you go outside the class you cant use it.outside the class you cannot use it

    //when you create something in Java you should name it
    //how to name a class: i)start with upper cases
// IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE WORDS EVERY WORD SHOULD START W UPPERCASE}
